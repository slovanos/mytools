Original Files Description:

- german_stopwords_plain.txt

A plain stopword list containing only "real" stopwords. A real stopword is limited to actual short function words like "der, die, das, mit, und, oder, denn, dann, ..." but without any nouns.

- german_stopwords_full.txt

The definition of this enhanced List is more loose, it contains stopwords + unwanted words. This list can contain nouns which are often used in a descriptive way without having a huge impact of the sentence meaning in e.g. search phrases.

- Negations.csv: Reference list of possible negations generated by Albatros



Modified versions:

- german_stopwords_full_wo_negs.txt (stopwords without negations)

The stopwords-list does NOT contain negation words such as kein*, nicht, ohne and weder. Considering that keeping these is necessary for sentiment analysis.


- german_stopwords_plain_wo_negs.txt (stopwords without negations)

Idem as above.


- german_stopwords_full_wo_negs_custom_vNN.txt

Customized version based on german_stopwords_full_wo_negs.txt. Adds to the list terms such as "zb", "inf", etc. and removes from the list terms such as "links" and "rechts"
